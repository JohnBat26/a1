# A1 Theme for Redmine

This is a fork of the A1 theme from [Redmine CRM](http://redminecrm.com/projects/a1theme/) which adds a mobile layout (so you can use it on your phone).

Not all pages have been optimized so far. But I promise I'll look at every pull request.

# How does it look?

Just try it out! No? Okay, here's quick a screenshot (not actually from a phone though):

As you can see, especially the navigation has been optimized (almost same effect happens when you press the icon in the main navigation).

# How to Install

Copy it to `public/themes/` and activate it. You may also read [the documentation](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Themes#Installing-a-theme).
